Unity version 
	KSP v1.3.1 -> Unity 5.4.0p4. Look in KSP Directory\KSP_x64_Data\output_log.txt and Unity version is listed 
	on the first line. Important to use the correct version if your debugging plugins. You can get away
	with using a different version of Unity for making parts.

Blender export
	I use "Export | Collada" with the setting shown in "Collada_Export.jpg". The Operator Presets can be used to 
	store the settings so you don't have to check them off each time. 
	Another format I see mentioned (actualy more often than Collada) is the FBX format.
	When using the Collada export in blender the root part of the model is always rotated 90 degrees on the X 
	axis when moved into Unity. First thing I do is zero the X axis rotation and remove the Animation (Provided 
	I don't need it). It's also possible to drop the bender file into Unity and you can directly edit the Blender
	file in the Unity directory so when you save in Blender, Unity is updated - not sure if there are any hidden Gotcha's
	with this method.

GIMP
	For these parts I left the textures in .png format but for a "to be used" part textures are generally 
	released in dds format. See https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/107940-psa-to-part-mod-authors-please-distribute-textures-as-dds-if-possible/
	The textures are 512 x 512 which is probably too small for some of the parts but does keep the package file size
	down. 

Tools used to make these parts:
Blender 2.79
Unity 5.4.0p4 personal
GIMP 2.8.16
