Unity
	KSP v1.6.1 -> Unity 2017.1.3p1. Look in KSP Directory\KSP_x64_Data\output_log.txt and Unity version is listed 
	on the first line. Important to use the correct version if your debugging plugins. You can get away
	with using a different version of Unity for making parts.
	When importing into Unity the names sometimes get changed ex: "Part.Mesh" becomes "Part_Mesh". If the config file
	needs a transform or part name it's often looking for the Unity name (NODE{} is a special case) so if you added the 
	object in Blender double check that Unity hasn't renamed it.

	Setting up a new project:
	Get the parttools file (see link below) and unzip somewhere - I keep mine in a "Tools" directory in my mod folder. Drop 
	the unzipped parttools in the Unity "Assets" pane and import it (popup should have a "Import" button). Each item that 
	you create will belong to a root GameObject. To create this root GameObject click GameObject | Create Empty from the main 
	menu then rename (optional) as needed. This is your root GameObject. Add parttools to the root by going to the Project pane
	Assets | PartTools | Lib , expand PartTools and drag the third item (also PartTools) onto the part's root object. Now 
	click on the root object and a "Part Tools (Script)" should show in the inspector pane. Setup the name of the part and the
	path where you want the .mu file to be written.

Blender export
	I use "Export | Collada" with the setting shown in "Collada_Export.jpg". The Operator Presets can be used to 
	store the settings so you don't have to check them off each time. Two other formats I see mentioned (actualy more 
	often than Collada) is the FBX format or simply drop the blender file into Unity. When using the Collada export in 
	blender the root part of the model is always rotated 90 degrees on the X axis when moved into Unity. First thing I 
	do is zero the X axis rotation and remove the Animator. It's also possible to drop the bender file into Unity and 
	you can directly edit the Blender file in the Unity directory so when you save in Blender, Unity is updated - not 
	sure if there are any hidden Gotcha's with this method.

GIMP
	For these parts I left the textures in .png format but for a "to be used" part textures are generally 
	released in dds format. See https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/107940-psa-to-part-mod-authors-please-distribute-textures-as-dds-if-possible/
	The textures are 512 x 512 which may be too small for some of the parts but does keep the package file size
	down. 

Config file
	As mentioned in the Unity section the config file will often reference a Unity transform or mesh name. The NODE 
	section in the config file can also generate a name - I've tried to note where a config name is used vs a Unity name 
	in the config comments.

Tools used to make these parts:
Blender 2.79
Unity 2017.1.3p1 personal (64bit) (for KSP 1.6.x)
GIMP 2.8.16

Part status:
	Added Fairing and a WIP landing leg. Tweaked notes and verified things still work in KSP 1.6.1

Some common problems:
	Symptom:
		The part doesn't show up in-game and the error log (KSP root dir/KSP.Log) has the following:
		[LOG 11:20:01.686] PartLoader: Compiling <Part KSP root dir/Path to your part/name of .mu file>
		[ERR 11:20:01.689] PartCompiler: Cannot clone model <Part KSP root dir/Path to your part/name of .mu file> as model does not exist
		[ERR 11:20:01.689] PartCompiler: Model was not compiled correctly
		[ERR 11:20:01.689] PartCompiler: Cannot compile model
		[ERR 11:20:01.689] PartCompiler: Cannot compile part
	Cause:
		The path to your part or the name of your part is spelled wrong or otherwise incorect. Note that
		you don't add the .mu on the end of the file name if you're using the "MODEL" section but you do add it 
		if you're using the "mesh =" syntacs.

	Symptom:
		The part doesn't show up in-game:
	Cause:
		If one of the modules uses a transform, mesh or animation and the name is spelled wrong in the
		config file the part won't show up. Error log will sometimes give a clue as to whats wrong ie "transform not found"

	Symptom	:
		The part can be selected in in-game and placed but can't be picked up again
	Cause:
		The collider is missing
